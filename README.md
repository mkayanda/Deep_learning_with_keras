Background of the project 


In this project we are using sythentic data that we will generate on our own. 

We assume an experimental drug was tested on individuals from ages 13 to 100 in a clinical trial. The Trial had 2100 participants half of which were under 65 years old and half were 65 years or older. 

95% of patients 65 or older experienced side effects while 95% patients under 65 experienced no side effects.
